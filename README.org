#+title: gis
#+subtitle: Get status information about multiple Git repositories

/gis/ is a Bash script which shows a status summary of multiple Git repositories.

It was inspired by [[https://wiki.ros.org/wstool][wstool]], [[https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool][vcstool]] and the default [[https://starship.rs/][Starship]] prompt.

* Usage

  #+begin_example
    Usage: gis [OPTIONS] [PATHS] ...

    Show a status summary of all Git repositories in PATHS.
    The colon-seperated environment variable $GIS_PATH is used if no PATH is given.
    If the variable isn't set, the current work directory is used.

    OPTIONS
      -f, --fetch  Execute 'git fetch --prune --all' for all repositories in PATHS
      -h, --help   Show this help message and exit
  #+end_example

* Installation

  Place the =gis= script somewhere in your =$PATH= *or* use the provided =install.{bash,zsh}= scripts.
  Those will create a symlink in =~/.local/bin= and update the respective =~/.{bash,zsh}rc=.
